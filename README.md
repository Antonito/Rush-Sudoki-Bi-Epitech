# Rush-Sudoki-Bi-Epitech
Rush during the first year of Epitech

It is a Sudoku solver.
It first tries to resolve the grid the "human way", and then if it fails, the grid is resolved via backtracking.

We had to respect a certain pattern of grid (provided in the "samples" directory).

Bonus : - A grid generator
        - Server / client : the client send the map to the server, the server resolves it,
          and then the client displays the resolved grid. (TCP socket)

Realized with Ludovic Petrenko.
